"""
This script is the boilerplate for a simple pipeline where no batch training is
needed.  This is suitable for many of the classfication model in sklearn that
do not support batch training.  Here I disabled loading of tod data. If it is
not suitable for a particular pipeline that you are working on, please enable
it by

pipe.set_load_data(True)

If you are working on more advanced models that support batch processing,
please refer to the batch_pipe.py.  """
